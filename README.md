## Overview

Bruhhh this was the hardest challenge for me because at first I was confused whether I was customing my own portfolio or following the given design. 

Im focusing on slicing the given design as pixel-perfect as possible all this time - so I was struggling to create my own design. one thing I know that I want to finish what I've started, so giving up is never an option. and also making it responsive without mobile design will take me a longer time to create the responsiveness. 

I do it one by one it took me about 1 week but finally finished the project. 

if u want to take a look on how i finish all the project on responsive challenge, u can find it on my github (find it on source code of this project)


im so happy i finally able to finish this project!
see ya all, wish u all the best with ur coding journey!


Check the [demo](https://deft-palmier-697697.netlify.app/) on how i did it :)
